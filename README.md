# Engine

Hi! This is a simple 3D render engine that I have developed in the first two months of the Advanced Programming for AAA Video Games Master from the UPC. In this file you will find a small guide of the engine usage.

## Guide

The first thing you will see when you turn on the Engine will be a loaded default model called BakerHouse. You can drag and drop the other two fbx files called Mickey Mouse and Room.

There will be a window console opened printing all the steps the engine is doing. 

### Menu
You can also check on the Menu the sections:

-> File: You can close the engine.

-> Tools: Opens the Configuration window and the Properties window.

-> Help: Opens a new tab on your browser to this github repository.

## Command list

You can move through the scene simmilar to the Unity 3D camera controls:

-> Mouse Right Click + WASD: First Person like movement.

-> Mouse Left Click + ALT: Orbits the center point of the scene.

-> Mouse Wheel: Zooms in and out.

-> F: Focus on the center point of the scene.

-> Shift: Increases Speed movement of the commands above.


## Future Improvements 
Be able to configure the scene using the ui.

Improve and fix some camera movements.
